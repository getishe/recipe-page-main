## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Young Serif](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Young+Serif) font family
- [Outfit](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit) font family

### What I learned

I learned how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox to create a responsive layout. I also learned how to use media queries to adjust the layout for different screen sizes.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

I plan to continue learning about CSS Grid and Flexbox. I also want to learn more about responsive design and how to create layouts that work well on different screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/) - This helped me understand how to use CSS Grid and Flexbox effectively. I really liked this article about [CSS Grid](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/complete-guide-grid/) and [Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/).
- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/) - This is a great resource for learning about HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used it to learn more about semantic HTML and how to use media queries.
- [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) - This is a great platform for practicing coding skills and building real-world projects. I used it to find this challenge and improve my skills.
